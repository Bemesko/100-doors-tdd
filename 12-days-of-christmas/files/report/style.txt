    Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.

    There are still many devices around that are limited to 80 character
    lines; plus, limiting windows to 80 characters makes it possible to
    have several windows side-by-side.  The default wrapping on such
    devices looks ugly.  Therefore, please limit all lines to a maximum
    of 79 characters. For flowing long blocks of text (docstrings or
    comments), limiting the length to 72 characters is recommended.
