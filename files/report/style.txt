    However the last line should end with a new line (warning W292).
/sandbox/test_doors.py:6:25: E712 comparison to False should be 'if cond is False:' or 'if not cond:'
    assert door.is_open == False
                        ^
    Comparison to singletons should use "is" or "is not".

    Comparisons to singletons like None should always be done
    with "is" or "is not", never the equality operators.

    Okay: if arg is not None:
    E711: if arg != None:
    E711: if None == arg:
    E712: if arg == True:
    E712: if False == arg:

    Also, beware of writing if x when you really mean if x is not None
    -- e.g. when testing whether a variable or argument that defaults to
    None was set to some other value.  The other value might have a type
    (such as a container) that could be false in a boolean context!
